    <div class="para"><p> With 23 years of spending my life in a city without exploring other places this is my first trip outside my home town as I was born and broughtup also studied and worked there
      did not get a opportunity to traverse elsewhere. To explore the world along with the focus to expedite my career as Web Programmer I made this hard decision to step out of my comfort zone. The below map
      depicts the route from my home town Tamil Nadu to my home in lindsay. The flight route was chennai - abu dhabi - toronto, it was a really long flight which took 28 hours of travel time. After reaching in the airport my sister family picked me up and we drove
      straight to the hotel named charminar and ate the dinner then returned to my sister house where I stayed about a month. September first is the date when I reached Lindsay. These whole process have been depicted in the map below.
